# Unbias Me

Reducing unconscious bias in reviewing job candidates' online materials.

## What it is

This is a Chrome extension that hides a candidate's profile picture and name when you're looking at their GitHub or LinkedIn page.

## Why?

More than two decades of research have indicated that despite our best efforts, unconscious bias is inescapable. But removing room for biases can help. (Auditioning musicians behind a privacy screen, for instance, is [famously credited with increasing the percentage of women musicians](http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2013/leveling-playing-field) in orchestras from 5 percent to 25 percent since the 1970s.)

## How do I install it?

 1. [Download the .crx file directly](https://github.com/fureigh/unbias-me/blob/master/unbias-me.crx?raw=true). If a pop-up appears, click 'Continue'.
 2. Click the three-line button ("the hamburger") in the top right corner of your browser.
 3. Go to 'More Tools' and then 'Extensions'.
 4. Check the 'Developer mode' box in the upper right corner.
 5. Locate the .crx file you downloaded in step 1.
 6. Drag and drop it onto the Extensions page. Confirm the subsequent pop-ups.

## Why not publish it to the Chrome extensions store?

I will, I'm just about to go to bed.
