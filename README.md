# Unbias Me

Reducing unconscious bias in reviewing job candidates' online materials.

## What it is

This is a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bghhadboobnoikppffdojcebigmcgmam/) that hides a candidate's profile picture and name when you're looking at their GitHub or LinkedIn page.

## Why?

More than two decades of research have indicated that despite our best efforts, unconscious bias is inescapable. But removing room for biases can help. (Auditioning musicians behind a privacy screen, for instance, is [famously credited with increasing the percentage of women musicians](http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2013/leveling-playing-field) in orchestras from 5 percent to 25 percent since the 1970s.)

## How do I install it?

It's easy: **[install directly from the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bghhadboobnoikppffdojcebigmcgmam/)**! (It's free.)
